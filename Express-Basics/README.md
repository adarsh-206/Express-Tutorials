# Express.js Router and Middleware Q&A

## Routers

**Q: What are routers in Express.js?**
Routers allow you to define groups of routes under a common URL prefix and separate them into separate files or modules. They provide a way to organize and modularize your web application's routes and middleware.

**Q: Why should I use routers?**
In scenarios like an e-commerce app with users, products, and cart sections, routers combine similar routes to make your code more organized and maintainable.

**Q: How can I create a router in Express?**
1. Create a router instance using the `express.Router()` function.
2. Define routes using methods like `router.get()`, `router.post()`, `router.put()`, and `router.delete()`.
3. "Mount" the router on a specific path using `app.use()`.

## Middlewares

**Q: What are middlewares in Express.js?**
Middlewares are functions that have access to the request object, response object, and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. They are used to modify request and response objects for tasks like adding response headers, security checks, data parsing, and more.

**Q: What are some common use-cases of middlewares?**
Some common use-cases of middlewares include performing security checks on user tokens or authentication, parsing the request body, sanitizing data, and handling user login processes.

## Folder Structure and Express Generator

**Q: What should be the ideal folder structure for an Express application?**
The ideal folder structure often involves organizing your code into directories for routes, views, public assets, and more. This structure can be conveniently generated using Express Generator.

**Q: What is Express Generator? How can it help with setting up an Express application?**
Express Generator is a command-line tool that quickly generates the basic structure of an Express.js application. It creates a template project with recommended directory structures, route files, view engine configurations, error handling middleware, and more. To use it, run `npx express-generator` or `npm install -g express-generator`.

Express Generator's features include:
- Setting up a recommended directory structure.
- Creating a basic server setup and entry point.
- Generating route templates with route handlers.
- Configuring a view engine (e.g., EJS or Pug).
- Providing basic error handling middleware.

By using Express Generator, you can jumpstart your project's setup and focus on building your application's specific features.
